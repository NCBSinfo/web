                    <b>Android App</b></br>
                    NCBSinfo is an application for regular use, especially helpful for people working at the
                    National Centre for Biological Science (NCBS), Bangalore.
                    Our aim is to create a mobile application, which will serve as an application-cum-database for
                    important information pertaining to NCBS. With the help of this, we will try to reduce the time
                    spent on searching for shuttle timings and contact numbers.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Web</b><br>
                    NCBSinfo web is specially made for non-android users who have no access to our android app.
                    However regular android user can also take advantage of this and can use this website to check
                    information as well as update preferences. These preferences will be synced between android app and
                    website.
